Crystalfontz' modification of Freescale's Community Yocto BSP
=============================================================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir crystalfontz-yocto
$: cd crystalfontz-yocto
$: repo init -u https://github.com/crystalfontz/crystalfontz-yocto-bsp -b dora-cfa
$: repo sync

Once this has completed, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: MACHINE=cfa100xx source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code will be checked out at crystalfontz-yocto/sources.
