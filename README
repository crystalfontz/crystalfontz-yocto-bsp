Crystalfontz' modification of Freescale's Community Yocto BSP
=============================================================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir crystalfontz-yocto
$: cd crystalfontz-yocto
$: repo init -u https://github.com/crystalfontz/crystalfontz-yocto-bsp -b dora-cfa
$: repo sync
$: source sync_and_patch.sh

Once this has completed, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: time bitbake demo-image-cfa-full

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code will be checked out at crystalfontz-yocto/sources.

Upon completion of the build (go out, do something, it'll be a while), 
your shiny new image will be ready to be burned to a microSD card.  You 
can find it in:
crystalfontz-yocto/build/tmp/deploy/images/cfa100xx/demo-image-cfa-full-cfa100xx.sdcard

You can burn it to the microSD card using the following commandline 
(from the build folder):

$: sudo dd if=./tmp/deploy/images/cfa100xx/demo-image-cfa-full-cfa100xx.sdcard of=/dev/sdb

** NOTE: /dev/sdb should be replaced with the device location of your 
microSD card in your development system **
